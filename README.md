## About The Project

The project creates a database which holds 3 tables:

    - Users : Is the table containing the users' data
      - Fields :
        - string: name
        - datetime: created_at
        - datetime: update_at

    - Events : is the table containing the events' data
      - Fields:
        - text: description
        - string: location
        - datetime: event_date
        - integer: user_id
        - datetime: created_at
        - datetime: update_at

      - user_id is the id of the creator user

    - Events_Users : is the Join Table that contains the users' events attendance
      - Fields :
        - integer: use_id
        - integer: event_id

Constraints for tables are as follows:

- Users Table

  - name: required

- Events Table

  - location: required

## Future Features

  - Creators of the each event may add images and other media, so users may have a taste of what to expect before the event 
  - Attendees may add comments and media on each event, so they can feed-back their experience

  - 'Invite' in the 'Select Attendees' list, or
